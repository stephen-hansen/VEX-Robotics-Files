# VEX-Robotics-Files
Public upload of my old high school code for VEX Robotics.
In the 'VEX' folder you'll find six subfolders:
- 2012 Projects
- 2013 Projects
- 2014 Projects
- 2015 Projects
- 2016 Projects
- Materials Engineering

Each subfolder contains numerous versions of code, as I was not well familiarized with Git in the past. 
Here are some summaries of each subfolder:

2012 Projects:
- Game was Sack Attack
- Written in 8th Grade

2013 Projects:
- Game was Toss Up
- Written in 9th Grade (HS Freshman)

2014 Projects:
- Game was Skyrise
- Written in 10th Grade (HS Sophomore)
- Competed in PA State Championship

2015 Projects:
- Game was Nothing but Net
- Written in 11th Grade (HS Junior)
- Competed in PA State Championship
- First year where I began to lead my own team

2016 Projects:
- Game was Starstruck
- Written in 12th Grade (HS Senior)
- Competed in PA State Championship and won PA State Champion Award
- Competed in Worlds Tournament in Louisville, Kentucky

Materials Engineering:
- Side project I made for Materials Engineering elective
- Written in 11th Grade (HS Junior)
- Project is a theremin instrument recreated with VEX parts

Going through each year, you should see some evolution in my code design as I learned more about RobotC.
(You'll also notice changes in my maturity with my code comments per year.)
